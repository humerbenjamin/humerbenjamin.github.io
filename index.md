# About Me

Welcome to my website! My name is Benjamin Humer, and I am a passionate Engineering Physics Student looking to turn my knowledge of both physics and engineering into a career where I innovate by integrating new physics into modern engineering problems. I am currently pursuing a BASc in Engineering Science with a specialization in Engineering Physics at the University of Toronto, where I also hold a minor in Sustainable Energy and a certificate in Nuclear Engineering.

Education has been the cornerstone of my journey, and my time at the University of Toronto has provided me with a solid foundation in engineering principles, physics, and sustainable energy solutions. I believe that harnessing the power of cutting-edge physics and applying it to real-world engineering challenges can pave the way for innovative advancements in sustainable energy technology.

## Work Experience

As a Data Analyst and Engineer at the Ocean Dynamics Lab, part of the University of British Columbia's Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Science, I have been involved in the development of systems to measure turbulent dynamics at the saltwater-freshwater interface. My role has included integrating new electronics systems into existing drifter technology, which has been featured on the drifter's website. This experience has provided me with valuable insights into ocean dynamics and the potential to apply novel physics-based solutions to better understand and address environmental challenges.

During my time at the University of Toronto's Department of Physics, I had the opportunity to work on the MATHUSLA Collaboration project. Here, I played a pivotal role in building a testing setup to analyze various components of the upcoming MATHUSLA detector to be constructed at CERN in 2026. The focus was on comparing wavelength shifting fibers, plastic scintillators, and Silicon photo multipliers, a task that demanded creative problem-solving and technical expertise.

Additionally, as part of the SuperCDMS Collaboration, I took up the responsibility of implementing continuous integration testing for sample data sets in CDMSBats. This vital work allowed us to verify the outputs of new releases of the software, thus ensuring its accuracy and efficiency.

## Programming and Technical Skills

My technical skills are a testament to my dedication to stay at the forefront of engineering and physics. I am proficient in various programming languages, including C, C++, Python, and Matlab. These languages have been instrumental in implementing innovative solutions to complex problems.

Furthermore, I have hands-on experience with a range of software tools, such as Git, Docker, Linux, Fusion360, Solidworks, and AutoCAD, which have proved to be indispensable in my engineering endeavors.

## Extracurricular Activities:

Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I am an avid athlete and adventurer. As a member of the University of Toronto Rowing Team, I have achieved recognition as the Men's Rookie of the Year in 2022 and the Men's Novice of the Year in 2021. Additionally, my involvement in the Argonaut Rowing Club's Senior Summer Rowing Team has seen me win medals in U23 pair events at regional and provincial summer championships.

Sailboat racing has also been a significant part of my life, with participation in international events along the west coast and Youth Nationals during my high school years. Racing primarily in the Laser, with some events in the 29er, has taught me the importance of precision, teamwork, and adaptability.

My passion for sports and adventure mirrors my approach to engineering and physics: driven, determined, and always seeking new challenges.

Conclusion:

As you explore this website, you will witness my dedication to integrating new physics into modern engineering problems. I believe that the marriage of physics and engineering holds the key to solving some of the most pressing global challenges. Join me on this journey of discovery and innovation as we push the boundaries of what's possible in engineering and beyond. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
