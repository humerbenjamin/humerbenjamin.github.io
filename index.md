# About Me

Welcome to my website! My name is Benjamin Humer, and I am a passionate Engineering Physics Student looking to turn my knowledge of both physics and engineering into a career where I innovate by integrating new physics into modern engineering problems. I am currently pursuing a BASc in Engineering Science with a specialization in Engineering Physics at the University of Toronto, where I also hold a minor in Sustainable Energy and a certificate in Nuclear Engineering. Education has been a key part of my journey into engineering so far, and my time at the University of Toronto has provided me with a solid foundation in engineering principles, physics, and sustainable energy solutions. I believe that harnessing the power of cutting-edge physics and applying it to real-world engineering challenges can pave the way for innovative advancements in sustainable energy technology.

Throughout my life, I've always balanced my education with competitive sport. While my academic pursuits demand focus and dedication, they have only been one component of my overall education and personal growth. My passion for sports has taught me invaluable life skills like discipline, time management, and resilience. Embracing the challenges of both worlds has been a balancing act that has enhanced my ability to prioritize tasks effectively. In high school, sailing provided an additional subject to study with its depth of strategy. In University, I began rowing because it is a primarily physical sport that perfectly compliments the naturally academic nature of university. Engaging in sailing and rowing has not only provided a much-needed outlet for stress but has also fostered camaraderie and teamwork. The demanding nature of competitive sports has taught me the art of perseverance and the importance of setting achievable goals. Ultimately, this dynamic combination has shaped me into a well-rounded individual, enriching my academic performance while instilling a profound appreciation for physical and mental well-being.

I am an avid hiker and adventurer, and the relationship I have with nature is the main motivator for the dedication that I have for my studies and work in engineering and physics which I believe may lead to sustainable energy systems. This love for the outdoors is also the reason why I have preferred sports that take place on the water, as these areas are always an escape from the downtown of every city I've ever lived in.

As you explore this website, you will witness my dedication to integrating new physics into modern engineering problems. I believe that the marriage of physics and engineering holds the key to solving some of the most pressing global challenges.
