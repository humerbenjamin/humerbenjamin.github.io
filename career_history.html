summer_research_desc:
  - excerpt: "# Summer Research Projects"
  - excerpt: "Throughout my education, I've worked on a different summer research experience each summer. 
  After first year, I worked with the SuperCDMS collaboration at the University of Toronto, after second year I worked with the MATHUSLA collaboration at the University of Toronto, and after third year I worked with the Ocean Dynamics Lab at the University of Toronto. 
  I have had the privilege of delving into diverse and impactful scientific projects, and these experiences have shaped my approach to learning and my future career. 
  The diversity of the projects that I have been able to contribute to has pushed the boundaries of my problem solving ability, and given me the confidence to systematically attack more complex problems."
