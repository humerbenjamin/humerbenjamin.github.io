# Specific Skills Used 

Programming (C, C++, python), High Performance Computing, Data Analysis, Software Testing

# Summary

In Summer 2021, I recieved an Engineering Science Research Opportunity (ESROP) grant to work on software testing for the Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (SuperCDMS) Collaboration at UofT under the Supervision of Professor Miriam Diamond. Throughout the summer, I attended conferences and seminars to gain understanding of the current state of experiments across different areas of High Energy Particle Physics. Once I understood the field better, I was able to properly understand the objectives of the experiment, and worked on various testing objectives, which culminated in work towards a continuous integration testing system for the Gitlab repository where the analysis packages were hosted.
