# Fluid Mechanics Background for Neutral Gases

Theory and background information is presented for technical readers who are not specialists in fluid mechanics or gas dynamics. Specialists in fluid mechanics or gas dynamics may not need to read this section of this page. It will be referenced in further sections of the page so readers can return to this technical content if required. Those familiar with the intricacies of DSMC may also not need to read the section outlining [DSMC](#direct-simulation-monte-carlo-dsmc).
