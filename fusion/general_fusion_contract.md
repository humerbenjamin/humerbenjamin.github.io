# Summary

I spent my time in UofT's [PEY Co-op Program](https://discover.engineering.utoronto.ca/experiential-learning/professional-experience-year-pey/) working at [General Fusion](https://generalfusion.com/) for 16 months from May 2024 to August 2025. As an Engineering Physics student, this was a phenomenal opportunity to work on Plasma Physics, and explore an industrial research environment. I worked primarily on MHD stability, first using experimental data to determine the physical mechanisms leading to X-ray crashes
