  - excerpt: "# Summer Research Projects
  
  Throughout my summer research experiences with SuperCDMS, MATHUSLA, and the UBC Ocean Dynamics Lab, I have had the privilege of delving into diverse and impactful scientific projects. Working with SuperCDMS, a cutting-edge physics collaboration at the University of Toronto, I contributed to the implementation of continuous integration testing for sample data sets in CDMSBats. This work ensured the accuracy and efficiency of the software, contributing to advancements in particle physics research. At MATHUSLA, a collaboration with the University of Toronto's Department of Physics, I built a testing setup to analyze components of the upcoming MATHUSLA detector at CERN. This opportunity allowed me to gain insights into detector technologies and their applications in high-energy physics. Additionally, my role as a Data Analyst and Engineer at the UBC Ocean Dynamics Lab involved developing systems to measure turbulent dynamics at the saltwater-freshwater interface. The integration of new electronics systems into existing drifter technology furthered our understanding of ocean dynamics and environmental phenomena. Overall, these summer research experiences have enriched my scientific knowledge, technical skills, and problem-solving abilities while contributing to cutting-edge advancements in multiple fields of research."
