# Abstract

This undergraduate thesis investigates the neutral gas distribution over time during the vacuum filling process in General Fusion’s PI-3 plasma injector. Previously, General Fusion had not simulated the dynamics of the PI-3 filling process, so there is an opportunity to further understand the gas distribution at the time of ionization, potentially increasing the total amount of plasma produced by modifying the filling process. This research models the gas distribution within an approximated PI-3 geometry over time using Direct Simulation Monte Carlo methods, and includes a detailed exploration of collisional Particle in Cell codes that could be used to extend this work into a full ionization model. The final simulations of the PI-3 plasma injector showed promising particle density in the Penning trap with some accumulation at the tip of the ionization chamber as well. It also showed that the peak number density was reached after over 300μs despite General Fusion only running their gas puff for 240μs. This should be further explored in the ionization model and other experiments to further optimize plasma formation in the PI-3 plasma injector.
