# Specific Skills Used 

Programming (C++, python), Circuit Design, Microcontroller Programming, CAD, 3-D Printing 

# Summary

In Summer 2022, I continued to work under the supervision of Miriam Diamond (as I had done during the previous summer working for the [**SuperCDMS Collaboration**](https://humerbenjamin.github.io/projects/UofT_CDMS)). The MATHUSLA Lab at UofT was working on materials testing, specifically testing properties of different types of Wavelength Shifting Fibers (WSFs), Plastic Scintillators, and Silicon Photo Multipliers (SiPMs). At the beginning of the summer, I built a comprehensive testing setup for all of these different components, and then after construction of the setup was finished, I gathered an initial round of test data, and analyzed it to determine general trends as to which materials would be preferred. At the end of the summer, a cosmic ray measurement setup was constructed which validated that the materials configuration would be able to detect cosmic rays on top of acting as a dark matter detector.
